    The goal of the game is to pass as many levels as possible and be the first to break the record!!<br>
Each button has its own unique color and sound. <br>
At each level the buttons will be pressed and play their sound, <br> and you will have to press the buttons in the order they were pressed. <br>
At each level another button will be added to the series of buttons, <br> so that a repeating pattern is created, and at each level another button is added to it. <br>
WARNING! if you don't press any button in 5 seconds, the game is over! <br>
The game improves visual memory as well as auditory memory, and provides fine motor skills and hand-eye contact. <br><br>
